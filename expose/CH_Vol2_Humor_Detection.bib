  title = {Large {{Dataset}} and {{Language Model Fun}}-{{Tuning}} for {{Humor Recognition}}},
  abstract = {The task of humor recognition has attracted a lot of attention recently due to the urge to process large amounts of user-generated texts and rise of conversational agents. We collected a dataset of jokes and funny dialogues in Russian from various online resources and complemented them carefully with unfunny texts with similar lexical properties. The dataset comprises of more than 300,000 short texts, which is significantly larger than any previous humor-related corpus. Manual annotation of 2,000 items proved the reliability of the corpus construction approach. Further, we applied language model fine-tuning for text classification and obtained an F1 score of 0.91 on a test set, which constitutes a considerable gain over baseline methods. The dataset is freely available for research community.},

  title = {Humor {{Detection}} in {{Yelp}} Reviews},
  abstract = {We utilize the state-of-the-art in deep learning to show that we can learn by example what constitutes humor in the context of a Yelp review. To the best of the authors knowledge, no systematic study of deep learning for humor exists \textendash{} thus, we construct a scaffolded study. First, we use ``shallow'' methods such as Random Forests and Linear Discriminants built on top of bag-of-words and word vector features. Then, we build deep feedforward networks on top of these features \textendash{} in some sense, measuring how much of an effect basic feedforward nets help. Then, we use recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks to more accurately model the sequential nature of a review.},
