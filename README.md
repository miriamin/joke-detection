Humor is a fundamental property of humans. Although scholars are
analyzing and studying humor since the Ancient Times, it is until today
not completely understood. In contrast to other NLP-related problems,
the computational treatment of humor is far behind.

Former research in computational humor was mainly carried out on Humor
Generation and Humor Detection. None of the humor generators
presented so far were able to produce human-like humor. From my
investigations I concluded two approaches which seemed promising for the
advancement of joke generators â€“ a generative and a restrictive
approach. A generative approach to humor generation would aim at
exclusively producing humorous output by preselecting suitable topics to
joke about. A restrictive approach on the other hand would consist of
two systems: A system that produces texts with structural features of
jokes and a second humor detection system that works as a filter letting
only the humorous texts pass. One approach for such a filter would be a
neural network for text classification with the target classes `joke`
and `no joke`.

The aim of this project is to assess the feasability of classifier algorithms for text classification for the application as
such a joke detector.
