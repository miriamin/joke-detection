1043," As the family gathered for a big dinner together the youngest son had an announcement to make: He'd just signed up at an army recruiter's office. There were audible gasps around the  table then some laughter as his older brothers shared their disbelief  that he could handle this new situation. ""Oh come on quit pulling our legs"" snickered one: ""You didn't really do that did you?"" ""I'm positive you'd never get through basic training"" scoffed another. The new recruit looked to his mother for help; but she was just gazing at him. When she finally spoke it was to voice a single question: ""Do you really plan to make your own bed every morning?"" ",1
607," If you were attacked by giant mutants, what would you do? Most people would run. Some would hide, and the video recorders would record it and put it on television.

Last week, humans won a war against giant vicious demons called, ""Razzoopis"". Razzoopis are Godzilla-sized monsters that have rock hard bodies, and breath fire.

No one knows why it came, or how it was defeated, but the other humans had a feeling that the humans gave back its baby. ",1
1052,"When Matt moved to Hollywood he made a pact with himself that if he wasn't a working actor in exactly seven years he'd quit the business and move back to Washington, DC. As the film opens Matt finds himself seven days shy of his self-prescribed deadline, and he's just as anonymous as the day he arrived into town. After an afternoon of soul searching in the mountains he decides to honor his deadline, and plans to spend his final week in Hollywood visiting friends to tell them he's leaving for good and that he'll have a going away party to cap it all off. With a couple days left before his going away party and tension mounting, Matt visits his eclectic mix of friends and people who have affected him over the years. Despite intending to tell them he's quitting the business, he chickens out, not quite being able to bring himself to tell them. On the night of the going away party he starts to think he's been stood up by everyone he thought he cared about and thought cared about him.",0

Day-Day is then spotted by D'wana, who said that she needed to go to the bathroom and gets chased out of the back entrance by Baby D and D'wana. The guys later make it back into the store to relax and talk about what's been going on lately.

Shortly after that situation, the record store owner Pinky returns and mistakes Craig for a thief attempting to rob his store.",0
387,"While there is a goal at the end of their journey - they intend to work in a leper colony in Peru - the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than 14,000 kilometres (8,700 mi) in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to bed as many women as will fall for his pick-up lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado's dilapidated Norton 500 motorcycle christened La Poderosa (""The Mighty One""). Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to La Poderosa's breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, often walking, and don't make it to Caracas until July. During their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the ""haves"" (to which they belong) and the obviously exploited ""have-nots"" (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by traveling on foot.",0

A common phrase used throughout the film, which is referred to in the Shenaniganz training video is ""The only thing different between extraordinary and ordinary, is that little bit of extra!"" This phrase is mocked by many of the wait staff during the film. Minutes before the restaurant closes, however, Chett and his girlfriend come in for dinner and leave Dean a hefty tip out of pity. This prompts Dean to quit his job—turning down an assistant manager position Dan offered him at the beginning of the film—to seek a more promising future. When the shift ends, the staff head to a party at Monty and Dean's house.",0

It is Salman's idea to put all the software on the internet, eliminating the need for a hard drive, RAM, a CD-ROM drive, a floppy drive, and anything that holds information. The computer has been reduced to a microprocessor, a monitor, a mouse, a keyboard, and the internet, but it is still too expensive. Having seen the rest of his team watching a hologram of an attractive lady the day before, in a dream Andy is inspired to eliminate the monitor in favor of the cheaper holographic projector. The last few hundred dollars comes off when Darrell suggests using virtual reality gloves in place of a mouse and keyboard. Tiny then writes a ""hypnotizer"" code to link the gloves, the projector, and the internet, and they're done.",0

After the marriage, he proves to be an utterly jealous husband who bars Fereshteh from having any contact with the outside world that he does not approve of, including association with Royā; although he does not know Royā at all, he feels a visceral hatred towards her, believing that she represents the liberal society that he finds so detestable. When Fereshteh applies to court for divorce, the presiding judge dismisses the case outright, stating that none of the actions of her husband, that suffocate her both emotionally and intellectually, were sufficient for the court to grant divorce. The judge's decision is based on Fereshteh answering a series of questions, such as whether her husband was violent, whether he was unfaithful, whether he had drugs additions, etc., in the negative; in response to Fereshteh's repeated pleas and appeal to her being a human being, the judge retorts not to waste the time of the court. It is remarkable that although one never sees Ahmad beating Fereshteh, in reality he is a violent man, as he constantly verbally abuses Fereshteh and often brandishes a kitchen knife while doing so; this is Milāni's sutbtle way of showing how domestic violence is often not recognized even by its very victims.
